It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

        <div class="bio">Hello, 

            My name is Martha Hagos. I am from ethiopia. I am a passionate, proficient, professional, UX/UI designer.   
            
            I started my art journey with painting and design. I first got introduced to design and arts in my freshman year of college in Addis Ababa university.Where I received my BFA in industrial Design, and Masters of Art in Fine Art. After graduation I worked as a curator in Modern Art Museum in Addis Ababa and worked as Assistant Art Director for international feature film. I have exhibited my art works in different parts of the world. 
            
            I have always wanted to work in digital design. Finding this program was dream come true. Learning UX/UI design has ignited my passion for art, design and problem solving.
            
            Beside the actual application of the job, my one takeaway is to approach any design first by thinking of users experience.
